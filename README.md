# UnityTutorial_Scripting

I have finished part 1 and 2 of the Unity tutorial:
  1. https://www.kodeco.com/4180726-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-1
  2. https://www.kodeco.com/4180875-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-2
  
Issues: the counter for dropped sheeps count 1 sheep as 2, I couldn't find the code or the place in the interface that was causing this issue.
